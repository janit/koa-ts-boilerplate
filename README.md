# Boilerplate for Koa, TypeScript and React for server side templating

A simple boilerplate that integrates the [Koa framework](http://koajs.com) with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) and [React.js for templating](https://medium.com/@velmu/react-is-gaining-ground-as-a-universal-server-side-templating-system-26fe02eebe12).

Note that this is not pushing React for the front end, but purely for a back end templating. If you need something universal, you can take a look at [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) or other similar solutions, starting for example with [Building Decoupled Sites and Apps with GraphQL and Next.js](https://malloc.fi/building-decoupled-sites-and-apps-with-graphql-and-next-js)

I might use this in the future, so it's mostly a personal backup. No warranty whatsoever.

## Installation

If you want to try it, first install [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) then run:

```
$ yarn
$ ts-node src/server.ts
```
